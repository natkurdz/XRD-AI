You’ll see the biggest wins when you have **numeric loops over arrays** that may be hard to handle with pure NumPy.\n","\n","### Great use cases\n","- **Loops with heavey computations** written in Python:\n","  - Example patterns: accumulate sums/products, distance computations, histogramming, simple state machines, dynamic programming, finite-difference stencils.\n","- **Elementwise math** and simple transforms:\n","  - Turn a scalar function into a ufunc via `@vectorize` (broadcasts like NumPy), note!! ufunc (universal function) is a NumPy-style function that can operate elementwise on arrays of any compatible shape, using **broadcasting** rules, without you writing loops\n","- **Structured loops over arrays** that don’t map cleanly to vectorization:\n","  For instance nested loops where each iteration may be cheap but there are lots of them.\n","- **Parallelizable loops** with little cross-iteration dependency:\n","  Use `@njit(parallel=True)` and `prange` for row/column-wise operations, reductions, or embarrassingly parallel sweeps.\n","- **Performance glue** around library calls:\n","  If 80% is already fast NumPy/BLAS, but 20% is Python loops, move that 20% into Numba.\n","\n","### When Numba won’t help much\n","- **Code dominated by Python objects** (strings, dicts of objects, arbitrary classes).\n","- **I/O bound tasks** (reading files, network requests).\n","- **Already-vectorized NumPy/BLAS** doing the heavy lifting (e.g., large `A @ B` matrix multiply is already in optimized C/Fortran).\n","- **Very small inputs** where JIT overhead dwarfs execution time.\n","\n","### Mental model\n","- **`@njit`** compiles a function at **first call** for the specific input types. Subsequent calls with the same dtypes are fast.\n","- **`nopython` mode** (what `@njit` enforces) keeps execution out of the Python interpreter—this is where the speedups come from.\n","- **Types matter.** Numba likes concrete dtypes: `float32`, `float64`, `int64`, etc. Passing different dtypes may trigger new compilations.\n","\n","### What “good” Numba code looks like\n","- Uses **NumPy arrays** with explicit dtypes.\n","- Prefers **for-loops** and simple indexing inside kernels (don’t fear loops—Numba compiles them).\n","- Avoids Python containers that change type/size (e.g., `list.append` of mixed types). If sizes are known, **preallocate arrays**.\n","- Keeps control flow clear and data-dependent branches predictable.\n","\n","### Parallelism with `prange`\n","- Replace `range` with **`prange`** in the **outermost** loop and add `@njit(parallel=True)`.\n","- Works best when iterations are independent or use simple reductions (`+=`, `min`, `max`).\n","- Start parallelizing only after the scalar kernel is correct and fast; then measure.\n","\n","### Fast math & numerics\n","- `@njit(fastmath=True)` allows more aggressive FP optimizations (FMA, reassociation).\n","- Expect tiny numerical differences; **validate tolerances** for your domain.\n","\n","### Benchmarking tips\n","- **Warm up** before timing: the first call includes JIT compilation.\n","- Time with a helper (e.g., `clock(fn, ...)`) and compare against a **NumPy baseline** for correctness (`np.allclose`).\n","- Use **representative problem sizes**; too small hides benefits, too large can hit cache/memory limits.\n","\n","**Rule of thumb:** If you catch yourself writing a performance-critical `for` loop in Python over numeric arrays, try moving that loop into an `@njit` function first. If iterations are independent, try `prange`. If it’s elementwise, try `@vectorize`.
